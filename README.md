# FinalProject
Love it or hate it, aviation has fundamentally changed the way we travel. Instead of the five hours to drive from Boston to New York, we can depart Logan and be on the ground again in 40 minutes, depending on if other air traffic cooperates with us. Regardless of the route, airplanes have made it easier for us to get from point A to point B. With there being over 8,000 commercial planes in the air on average at any given time, there is plenty of data to analyze.
We found a dataset containing information regarding domestic U.S. flights from 1990 to 2009. The data includes origin and destination cities and airports, the number of passengers, seats, and flights available monthly on those routes, and the population and coordinates of both the origin and destination. Using complex Python code, we will analyze this data and answer questions regarding the feasibility of the routes and how the routes are conducted using the last five years. These questions include how are flights all connected, which airports are the busiest, what types of aircraft are used on these flights, and are some routes even worth flying?
